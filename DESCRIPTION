Description: Allows the creation of forest plots with advanced features, such as 
    multiple confidence intervals per row, customizable fonts for individual text 
    elements, and flexible confidence interval drawing. It also supports mixing 
    text with mathematical expressions. The package extends the application of 
    forest plots beyond traditional meta-analyses, offering a more general version 
    of the original 'rmeta' packageâ€™s forestplot() function. It relies heavily on 
    the 'grid' package for rendering the plots.
