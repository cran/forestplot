\title{Regression coefficients and confidence intervals from HRQoL study}
\description{
The data is a list containing the Swedish and the Danish
coefficients for health related quality of life (HRQoL) 1
year after total hip arthroplasty surgery. The age is
modelled as a spline and is therefore presented as a
contrast.
